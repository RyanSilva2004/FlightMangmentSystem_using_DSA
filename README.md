# PathFinder: Implementing Data Structures for Efficient Geolocation Services

## Project Description

PathFinder is a software application that demonstrates the meaningful application of various data structures in real-world scenarios. The primary focus of this project is to implement a mapping and navigation system similar to Google Maps.

## Data Structures Used

The following data structures are used in this project:

- *Graph*: Represents locations as nodes and roads as edges. Information like distance, traffic, and road conditions are stored on these edges.
- *Heap: A min-heap is used in pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's or A to quickly get the next node with the shortest tentative distance.
- *Trees (Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree)*: Used to store map data like place names, street names, etc., allowing for fast lookup, addition, and removal of locations or streets.
- *Doubly Linked List or Circularly Linked List*: Represents a specific route from one location to another, allowing easy movement forwards and backwards through the route.

## Features

PathFinder provides the following features:

1. *Route Planning*: Users can input a start and end location, and the application provides the best route based on various factors.
2. *Location Search*: Users can search for specific locations, such as addresses, landmarks, businesses, etc.
3. *Turn-by-Turn Navigation*: Provides turn-by-turn navigation instructions to guide the user to their destination.
4. *Traffic Information*: Displays real-time traffic information, helping users anticipate delays and find alternative routes when necessary.
5. *Public Transit Information*: Provides information about public transit options, including routes, schedules, and estimated travel times.
6. *Points of Interest*: Highlights points of interest, such as restaurants, parks, museums, etc., in the map view.
7. *Offline Access*: Provides an option to download maps for offline use in areas with poor internet connectivity.
